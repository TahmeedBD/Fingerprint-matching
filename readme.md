# Fingerprint Matching Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can match two given rgb fingerprint images captured by a camera. The model is developed using the SOCOFing dataset, which contains 6,000 fingerprints from 600 subjects. The goal is to create a robust fingerprint matching system that can be used in any real world application
